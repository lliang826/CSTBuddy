# Images:

All but for 2 pictures used were obtained from attribution-free sources. 

The two exceptions are the BCIT-logo.png and education.jpg which were used
due to our projects adjacency to the British Columbia Institute of 
Technology since we are currently enrolled a program at the institute. 

These images were found on https://www.bcit.ca and are used with the 
understanding that our project is related to the school and it's students.

# Libraries:

Bootstrap -> Used various Bootsrap componenets
https://getbootstrap.com/

Firebase -> Used firebase to register and store data (technically in firestore).

# Open-source projects:

Initally started using the chatbot created by Landgreen as a template
https://codepen.io/lilgreenland/pen/pyVvqB 

However, have significantly changed a vast majority of the code and functionality to suit our specific project.
